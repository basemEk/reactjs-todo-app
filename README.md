# Codeminos in house ToDo app with Bassem

## Detailed Problem Description

Nowadays, it is becoming more and more difficult to track employee tasks and performance.
Not having one platform that all employee uses for adding tasks and interacting with them become harder for the management team.

## Expected solution description

A ToDo app solution is required. It consists of a web application where users can register / sign-up to create an account.

> Every user will be able to track his / her todos by performing the operation below :

- [ ] Create a todo task
- [ ] Create a recurring toDo
- [ ] Update a todo task
- [ ] Delete a todo task
- [ ] archive a todo task

## Propreties

> Every task can have a title, description, date , priority and multiple labels

## Constraint

- [ ] Every `task` can have a date in the `future` or `present` but not in the `past`.

- [ ] When a `task` get archived it would not get deleted but it would not appear on the user main screen.

## Filtering

> Users should be able to filter tasks by priority or by labels

> Users should be able to filter tasks by the added date or by the target date when this task gonna be achieved.
